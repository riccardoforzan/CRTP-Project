# Concurrent and Real Time Programming 2022

Project for the course: Concurrent and Real Time Programming @ UniPD

The aim of this project is to develop an architecture with a single producer and multiple consumers.
To monitor the status of the execution, periodically, a third actor `monitor` sends information using TCP to a remote server.
